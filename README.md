## What is this?
A set of take-home questions to assess your technical skills with Cypress. After cloning and setting yourself up, you
will have a small scale web application against which you will write test assertions. Step by step instructions will introduce
you to common situations we are currently facing at work.  

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important 
Submit answers that YOU think are the most relevant, there is NO right or wrong answers!

## What's next?
Follow these steps to get a local version of this project:

npm ci

# Start the webapp

```

## To submit your solution
